# InstaClone
The header file or the index.html file contains:
1. The necessary structure for the Instagram clone, such as the header, stories container, posts container, and footer.
2. The header contains the Instagram logo, a search box, and a menu.
3. The stories container displays circular profile images of users in a horizontal scrollable bar.
4. The posts container displays the posts, including images, captions, buttons, and comment sections.
The css file has a styling element and javascript has an implementation part.
One feature has been added which is a color palette generator. These colors will be extracted from the uploaded image of the post using a random color generation algorithm.
The color palette will consist of small circular divs, each representing a different color extracted from the image.
